# Playwright Python Automation Project

This repository documents the practical outcomes of a course focused on end-to-end automation using Playwright and Python. Some files and credentials have been deliberately removed to ensure security. All original implementations were successfully tested through Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.

## Course Outcomes

The course delivered structured knowledge and hands-on practice in the following areas:

- Python programming fundamentals with coding exercises and assignments
- Web automation using Playwright with real-time examples
- API testing and network interception with Playwright
- Visual testing, mobile device emulation, and test execution in Docker-based CI/CD environments
- Complete understanding of Pytest framework from the ground up
- Usage of Playwright Inspector, Trace Viewer, and CodeGen tools
- Industry-standard framework design incorporating Pytest and BDD methodologies

## Course Description

This Playwright Python course covers everything from basic programming to advanced automation framework design. It begins with Python and Pytest fundamentals, requiring no prior coding experience.

Combining Python with Playwright enhances automation capability, offering scalability, AI integration potential, and cross-platform reliability.

### Why Python?

Pythonâ€™s syntax simplicity and ecosystem maturity make it ideal for both automation and AI development. It is widely used in QA, DevOps, and data science workflows.

### Why Playwright?

Playwright supports fast, reliable, cross-browser testing for both UI and API layers. Its adoption is accelerating as a superior alternative to Selenium, especially for modern web apps.

## Skills Acquired

- Python scripting and test automation
- Full-featured browser automation using Playwright
- API request validation and network mocking
- Implementation of visual comparison and mobile emulation
- Modular, scalable test design using Pytest
- Trace analysis and test debugging via Playwright tools
- End-to-end test framework development using Pytest and BDD concepts

## Final Note

This repository reflects my implementation of the course learnings. While some elements are redacted for safety, the full system operates correctly under CI/CD conditions. Contact for details or verification if needed.
